# image-to-ascii-converter

An image to ASCII art app is a software that converts a given image into ASCII characters. The ASCII characters are used to create a pixelated representation of the image, where each ASCII character represents a small block of pixels in the image. The ASCII art is created by mapping the grayscale or color values of the pixels in the image to a set of ASCII characters, with darker pixels being represented by darker characters and lighter pixels being represented by lighter characters.

The conversion process involves several steps, including:

Load the image: The image is loaded into memory, and its size and pixel data are extracted.

Convert the image to grayscale: The image is converted to grayscale if it is in color, which makes it easier to map the pixels to ASCII characters.

Map the pixels to ASCII characters: The grayscale or color values of the pixels in the image are mapped to a set of ASCII characters, based on the brightness of the pixels. A lookup table or algorithm is used to determine which ASCII character should be used for each pixel.

Create the ASCII art: The ASCII characters are arranged in a grid to create the ASCII art, with each character representing a small block of pixels in the image.

Save the ASCII art: The ASCII art can be saved to a text file or displayed in a text area or on the screen.

The end result is a pixelated representation of the image created using ASCII characters, which can be saved or displayed in a variety of formats.

you can create one for binarry numbers by changing the symbol characters to "1" and "0" respectively

feel free to fork for new ideas etc.
